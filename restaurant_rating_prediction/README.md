# Restaurant Rating Prediction System: Analysis and Implementation
## Cognifyz Technologies - Task 1

### Abstract
This study presents the development and implementation of a machine learning-based system for predicting restaurant ratings. The research utilized a comprehensive dataset containing various restaurant attributes including location, cuisine types, and customer engagement metrics. Through systematic data preprocessing and model evaluation, we successfully developed a prediction system achieving remarkable accuracy in estimating restaurant ratings.

### Introduction
The restaurant industry's digital transformation has led to an increasing reliance on rating systems for consumer decision-making. Understanding and predicting these ratings has become crucial for both restaurant owners and platforms. This project aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting restaurant ratings based on various features, providing insights into the factors that influence customer satisfaction.

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The initial dataset underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure quality and usability. We began by addressing missing values and removing redundant information such as restaurant identifiers and duplicate location details. Categorical variables required special attention; we implemented label encoding for binary features (such as table booking and online delivery options) and developed a sophisticated encoding scheme for cities and cuisines.

For city-based features, we implemented a threshold-based grouping mechanism where cities with fewer than 250 restaurants were consolidated into an 'Other' category. This approach helped balance the need for geographical representation while preventing data sparsity issues. The analysis revealed significant concentration in major cities, with New Delhi hosting 5,473 restaurants, followed by Gurgaon (1,118) and Noida (1,080).

Cuisine information presented unique challenges due to its multi-label nature. We identified and encoded the top 15 cuisine types, including North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food, which showed the highest representation in the dataset. This encoding preserved crucial culinary information while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Methodology and Model Implementation
We implemented two distinct regression approaches: Linear Regression as a baseline model and Random Forest as an advanced alternative. The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with numerical features undergoing standardization using StandardScaler.

A significant finding emerged during feature analysis: the number of votes showed strong correlation with ratings. To address this, we applied logarithmic transformation to the votes feature, which helped normalize its distribution and reduce its dominance while preserving its predictive power.

### Results and Analysis
The Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an R² score of 0.9543 and a Mean Squared Error of 0.1047. This significantly outperformed the Linear Regression model, which achieved an R² score of 0.7267. The feature importance analysis revealed that even after logarithmic transformation, user engagement (votes) remained the most influential predictor, accounting for approximately 95.7% of the model's predictive power.

To validate the model's robustness, we conducted an experiment excluding the votes feature entirely. This resulted in an R² score of 0.3660, highlighting the significant role of user engagement in rating prediction while also demonstrating that other features (location, cuisine type, and price range) contribute meaningful predictive value.

### Discussion and Insights
The high predictive accuracy achieved by our model suggests strong patterns in restaurant ratings. The dominance of the votes feature indicates a strong correlation between popularity and ratings, possibly reflecting a feedback loop where highly-rated restaurants attract more customers and, consequently, more votes.

The geographical analysis revealed significant regional variations in rating patterns, with certain cities showing distinct rating distributions. Price range emerged as the second most important feature, suggesting a relationship between pricing strategy and customer satisfaction.

### Practical Applications and Limitations
While the model shows excellent predictive capability, its heavy reliance on voting data suggests potential limitations for new restaurants with limited user engagement. Future iterations might benefit from developing separate models for new versus established restaurants or incorporating additional features such as temporal data or review text analysis.

### Conclusion
This study successfully developed a robust restaurant rating prediction system with high accuracy. The findings provide valuable insights for restaurant owners and platform operators, highlighting the complex interplay between popularity, location, cuisine type, and customer satisfaction. Future work could explore temporal aspects of ratings and incorporate more nuanced features to enhance predictive capability for new establishments.

### Technical Implementation Details
The system was implemented in Python, utilizing scikit-learn for machine learning operations, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for visualization. The complete implementation includes modular functions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, ensuring reproducibility and maintainability.
